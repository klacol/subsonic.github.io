# Inline Query Tool

Sometimes there's just no way an ORM can do what you want it to do, and I completely recognize this. It's just not a good idea to try to use your ORM for everything - and it's why I always say "SubSonic isn't really an ORM - it's a query tool".  Given that, we want to give you a back door, and in honor of Jeff Atwood we created the Inline Query tool. Go ahead - no one's looking... do your job and be proud of it.

```csharp
public void Inline_Simple()
   {
       QueryCommand cmd = new InlineQuery().GetCommand("SELECT productID from products");
       Assert.IsTrue(cmd.CommandSql("SELECT productID from products");
   }

public void Inline_WithCommands()
   {
       QueryCommand cmd
             = new InlineQuery()
                   .GetCommand(@"SELECT productID from products WHERE productid=@productid", 1);
       Assert.IsTrue(cmd.Parameters[0].ParameterName == "@productid");
       Assert.IsTrue((int)cmd.Parameters[0].ParameterValue == 1);
   }

public void Inline_AsCollection()
   {
       ProductCollection products
          =    new InlineQuery()
                   .ExecuteAsCollection<ProductCollection>(@"SELECT productID from products WHERE productid=@productid", 1);
   }
```
